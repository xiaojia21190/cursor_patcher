Alist Helper includes several useful features:

- Automatic launching of alist
- Minimizing to the system tray
- Automatic startup on boot, with the option for silent startup
- Quick access to alist version and administrator information
- Adjustable alist startup parameters. You can customize the startup parameters to meet your specific needs and preferences.

Free. No tracking. No ads.

Currently, this app is available on Windows and macOS. Adaptation plans for more platforms are in progress.

Please note that this program does not include the binary files for alist. You will need to download them manually.
